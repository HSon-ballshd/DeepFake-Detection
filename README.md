Answer me Jia Baoyu, what does Rupture need?

What rupture needs... Even if an answer to your question existed, what meaning would it have? With our statuses that are but sparks that go out in the blink of an eye, what meaning would all this sinking, bleed, tremor and burn have? They'll all float away with the flow anyway. So... if rupture needs anything, I guess, it might need to find something like... contentment in low count and the joy of having potency. To not desire count, nor to discard what effects are given to us... and instead, to simply fully accept the potency. That must be the remorseless path to true inner peace, right?

However, Jia Baoyu... I must doubt the truthfulness behind your words. For rupture... does not know poverty. Thus, I am compelled to believe that you have yet to give me a real answer. I will ask again, what does rupture need? What is it that ids need-those who are too busy clashing, too busy corroding, too busy simply persisting, posing?

What rupture needs... rupture needs... a long fight viability, clashing, and good damage in both base skills and ego. Wouldn't it be nice to live a nice, fortunate life, free from any of the power creep of the world from the beginning to the end of your viability?

You spew such hollow, worthless lies in place of the truth you nearly uttered. Let it out. Your truth. To be content with the potency given to us, and to have good viability unburdened by bad numbers and damage on account of inequities... They may both be answers, indeed. Yet... I am yet to hear your answer. That answer, hiding in the shadows of your hesitation. The rupture that you buried deep within.

My lord, while there is effort, he is-

Withdraw now, Mao Faust. It seems that a brutal nerf must come afore I am to measure the rupture within him
Reflect upon your rupture! Exhume your ids, your unique statuses from deep within!

What rupture needs...


*cut to flashback*

Little Baoyu, you cannot save every status.

I know I can't save every status, But... Atleast this one id that is about to be nerfed, please...


...Is count.

To have count is to care for your status, to embrace the potency you have. It is to clash alongside a mediocre id. It is to join in nuke turns when the opponent is elated with rupture. It needs count for good potency and unique statuses.
